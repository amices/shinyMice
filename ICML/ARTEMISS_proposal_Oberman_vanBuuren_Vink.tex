\begin{abstract}
Iterative imputation is a popular tool to accommodate missing data. While it is widely accepted that valid inferences can be obtained with this technique, these inferences all rely on algorithmic convergence. There is no consensus on how to evaluate the convergence properties of the method. Our study provides insight into identifying non-convergence in iterative imputation algorithms. We found that---in the cases considered---inferential validity was achieved after five to ten iterations, much earlier than indicated by diagnostic methods. We conclude that it never hurts to iterate longer, but such calculations hardly bring added value.

\section{Iterative Imputation}
\label{intro}

To draw inference from incomplete data, most imputation software packages use iterative imputation procedures. With iterative imputation, the validity of the inference depends on the state-space of the algorithm at the final iteration. This introduces a potential threat to the validity of the imputations: What if the algorithm has not converged? Are the imputations then to be trusted? And can we rely on the inference obtained using the imputed data?

These remain open questions since the convergence properties of iterative imputation algorithms have not been systematically studied \citep[\(\S\) 6.5.2]{buur18}. While there is no scientific consensus on how to evaluate the convergence of imputation algorithms \citep{zhu15, taka17}, the current practice is to visually inspect imputations for signs of non-convergence. This approach may be undesirable for several reasons: 1) it may be challenging to the untrained eye, 2) only severely pathological cases of non-convergence may be diagnosed, and 3) there is not an objective measure that quantifies convergence \citep[\(\S\) 6.5.2]{buur18}. Therefore, a quantitative, diagnostic method to identify non-convergence would be preferred. 

\section{Identifying Non-Convergence}
\label{methods}

In our study, we consider two non-convergence identifiers: autocorrelation \citep[conform][p.~147]{lync07} and potential scale reduction factor $\widehat{R}$ \citep[conform][p.~5]{veht19}.\footnote{As recommended by e.g. \citet{cowl96}.} Aside from the usual parameters to monitor---chain means and chain variances \citep[\(\S\) 4.5.6]{buur18}---we also investigate convergence in the multivariate state-space of the algorithm. 

We implement \citet[\(\S\) 6.5.1]{buur18}'s recommendation to track the parameter of scientific interest, and subsequently propose a novel parameter: the first eigenvalue of the variance-covariance matrix that is obtained after imputing the missing data. Compared to monitoring the estimate of scientific interest, this novel parameter has the appealing quality that it is not dependent on the complete-data inference. With that, it suits one of the main advantages of imputation techniques---solving the missing data problem and the substantive scientific problem separately.

% Moreover, the behavior of such algorithms under certain default imputation models (e.g., `predictive mean matching') is an entirely open question \citep{murr18}. 

% \footnote{If the algorithm does not reach convergence, ``the imputed datasets will not be truly independent and the variability among them may understate the true levels of missing-data uncertainty'' (Schafer and Olsen, p. 556).}

% 
% 
% Therefore, we propose a novel parameter to inspect. We use this parameter to identify non-convergence with two quantitative diagnostic methods. We use model-based simulation to investigate the plausibility of identifiers for non-convergence for iterative imputation algorithms and provide guidelines for empirical research. For reasons of brevity, we only focus on the iterative imputation algorithm implemented in the popular \texttt{mice} package in \texttt{R} \citep{mice, R}. \textit{[Provide notation here? E.g., the number of imputations, iterations, etc.]}

We evaluate the performance and plausibility of these diagnostic methods through model-based simulation in $\mathtt{R}$ \citep{R}. For reasons of brevity, we only focus on the iterative imputation algorithm implemented in the popular $\mathtt{mice}$ package in $\mathtt{R}$ \citep{mice}. 


% \section{Methods}
% \label{methods}
% 
% \subsection{Diagnostic Methods}
% We consider several sets of diagnostic methods to identify non-convergence in the iterative imputation algorithm. Each method is a combination of a parameter that summarizes the state-space of the algorithm, $\theta$, and an identifier. As $\theta$s we use the default parameters of the \texttt{MICE} algorithm (i.e., the univariate $\theta$s chain means and chain variances), a model-dependent user-specified multivariate parameter $Q$, and a novel parameter: $\lambda_1$. $\lambda_{1}$ has the appealing property that it is not dependent on the model of scientific interest, yet still summarizes the multivariate state-space of the algorithm.
% 
% We define $\lambda_{1}$ as the first eigenvalue of the variance-covariance matrix of the completed data.\footnote{By definition, this is equal to the variance of the first component of the principal component analylis (PCA) solution on the same data.} For each imputation $\ell$, let $\lambda_{1, \ell} \geq \lambda_{2, \ell} \geq ... \geq \lambda_{j, \ell}$ be the eigenvalues of the variance-covariance matrix $S_{\ell}$, where $\ell = 1, ..., m$. Since the eigenvalues of a variance-covariance matrix summarize the total set of covariances in the data, $\lambda_1$ captures the multivariate nature of the completed data without imposing a substantive model of interest. 
% 
% The identifiers are as recommended by e.g. \cite{cowl96}, namely the potential scale reduction factor $\widehat{R}$ and autocorrelation. $\widehat{R}$ is also known as the `Gelman-Rubin statistic' after the original paper \cite{gelm92}. We use a recently proposed adapted version of $\widehat{R}$ \citep{veht19}. We diagnose non-convergence if $\widehat{R}$-values exceed a certain diagnostic threshold. The thresholds under consideration are the traditional threshold $\widehat{R}=1.2$ \citep{gelm92}, the common $\widehat{R}=1.1$ \citep{gelm13}, and the recent $\widehat{R}=1.01$ \citep{veht19}. 
% 
% We diagnose non-convergence with autocorrelation when the correlation between two subsequent $\theta$-values within the same chain is significantly different from zero \citep[p.~147, p.~42]{lync07, hynd18}.

\section{Simulation Study}

The aim of the simulation study is to determine the impact of non-convergence on the validity of statistical inferences, and to assess whether non-convergence may be detected using several diagnostic methods. Inferential validity is reached when estimates are both unbiased and have nominal coverage across simulation repetitions ($n_{\rm sim}=1000$).

To induce non-convergence in the imputation algorithm we use  two sets of simulation conditions: early stopping and missingness severity. Early stopping implies that we vary the number of iterations before terminating the imputation algorithm (between 1 and 100 iterations). The missingness severity is determined\footnote{I.e., we only consider a `missing completely at random' missingness mechanism \citep{rubin76}.} by the proportion of incomplete cases (between 5 and 95\%). We provide a summary of the simulation set-up in Algorithm \ref{alg:setup}, whereas the complete script and technical details are available from \href{https://github.com/hanneoberman/MissingThePoint}{github.com/hanneoberman/MissingThePoint}. 

\begin{algorithm}
   \caption{Simulation set-up}
   \label{alg:setup}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Simulate data 
\REPEAT 
% \FOR {$p_{\rm inc} = .05, .25, .50, .75, .95$ (missingness conditions)}

  \FOR {all early stopping conditions}
   \STATE Impute missingness

\STATE Aggregate outcomes across simulation runs
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


% The aim of the simulation study is twofold: 1) to determine the effect of early stopping and missingness conditions on the validity of statistical inferences, 2) to investigate the plausibility of identifiers for non-convergence. 
% 
% We assess the validity of statistical inferences with bias, coverage rate and confidence interval width as performance measures (see @buur18 for definitions). And we evaluate the plausibility of the identifiers using the diagnostic thresholds for $\widehat{R}$ and autocorrelation (i.e., $\widehat{R}=1.2,1.1,1.01$ and the critical value for AC = 0).
% 
% \textit{[Very incomplete from here!]} We consider several quantities of scientific interest.
% 
% The statistical inference of interest is multivariate linear regression.
% 
% The data generating mechanism of the predictor space is a multivariate normal distribution

\section{Results}
\label{results}

Our results indicate that inferential validity is achieved after five to ten iterations, even under severe missingness conditions (i.e., up-to 95\% of cases having missing values). Conditions with a lower proportion of incomplete cases yield valid inferences almost instantly---after just two iterations. This is in grave contrast to the non-convergence identified by the diagnostic methods. Autocorrelation- and $\widehat{R}$-values still indicate improving convergence after 20 to 30 iterations. 


\begin{figure*}
{\centering \includegraphics{Figures/results} 
}
\caption{Subset of simulation results (truncated at 50 iterations). Depicted are performance measures percentage bias and coverage rate, and non-convergence identifiers autocorrelation and $\widehat{R}$ for a regression estimate. The solid gray lines represent inferential validity of the estimate (i.e., unbiasedness and nominal coverage), whereas the dashed gray lines depict common diagnostic thresholds of the identifiers.}\label{fig:res}
\end{figure*}

For example, in Figure \ref{fig:res} we show some results for a regression estimate. Depicted are percentage bias, coverage rate,  autocorrelation and $\widehat{R}$ of the estimate. From this, we see that within a few iterations the percentage bias approaches zero and nominal coverage is quickly reached---even when autocorrelation and $\widehat{R}$ would still signal non-convergence. This also holds for scenarios with severe missingness. Moreover, results seem invariant to the choice of parameter for the non-convergence diagnostics. The novel parameter that we propose has equal performance to the scientific estimate presented in Figure \ref{fig:res},\footnote{The Spearman correlation between the autocorrelation values for the two parameters is $r=.982$, and $r=.978$ between the $\widehat{R}$-values.} while having the advantage of being independent from the scientific model of interest. 

% Results are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:est} and \ref{fig:diag}. Simulation conditions with a high proportion of missing cases and a low number of iterations most often result in biased estimates and non-nominal coverages. 
% 
% \textit{[Copy-paste from here!]} These results demonstrate that the estimates of univariate scientific estimands \(Q\) are not impacted by early stopping of the MICE algorithm or the proportion of incomplete cases in \(y\). Unbiased estimates may be obtained after just one iteration. Multivariate estimates, by contrast, are affected by both the number of iterations and the proportion of missing cases. Completely unbiased estimates are only obtained under low to moderate missingness (\(p_{\rm inc}\leq.50\)), after at most three iterations. We observe approximately unbiased estimates after at most seven iterations (for any \(p_{\rm inc}\) considered). This implies that the algorithm produces stable, non-improving estimates when \(T\geq7\).

% \begin{figure*}
% {\centering \includegraphics{Figures/Rplot} 
% }
% \caption{Non-convergence identified by diagnostic methods: $\widehat{R}$ and $AC$ applied on several $\theta$s. The left-hand side of the figure contains $\widehat{R}$-values, and the right-hand side contains $AC$-values. Depicted in the rows are the scalar summaries $\theta$: chain mean, chain variance, the quantity of scientific interest $\hat{Q}$, and the first eigenvalue of the variance-covariance matrix $\lambda_1$.}\label{fig:diag}
% \end{figure*}
% 

% Overall, the methods to diagnose non-convergence perform as expected: they indicate more signs of non-convergence in conditions with worse performance in terms of bias and confidence-validity. Under low to moderate missingness, it does not seem to matter on which \(\theta\) the non-convergence diagnostics are applied. If we look at complete unbiasedness, however, we notice that univariate \(\theta\)s fail to diagnose the persistent bias in conditions where \(p_{\rm inc}\geq.75\).
% 
% The number of iterations necessary to obtain approximately unbiased, confidence-valid estimates corresponds to the \(\widehat{R}\) threshold 1.2. The thresholds 1.1 and 1.01 seem too strict compared to the validity of the inferences. The threshold to diagnose significant \(AC\)-values does not appear to be appropriate in at least the current set-up, and perhaps in iterative imputation in general. A better heuristic to diagnose non-stationarity with \(AC\) may be through evaluation of the \(AC\)-values across iterations: If the values do not substantially decrease with \(T\), approximate stationarity may be concluded.

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

With this study, we show that iterative imputation algorithms can yield correct outcomes, even when a converged state has not yet formally been reached. Any further iterations would then burn computational resources without improving the statistical inferences. Preliminary findings suggest that these results also hold for more challenging scenarios, e.g. under different missingness mechanisms or imputation models. 

Our study found that---in the cases considered---inferential validity was achieved after five to ten iterations, much earlier than indicated by the autocorrelation and \(\widehat{R}\) diagnostics. Of course, it never hurts to iterate longer, but such calculations hardly bring added value.
