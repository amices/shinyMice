This repository serves the development of `ShinyMICE`, an interactive evaluation device for missing data by Hanne Oberman and Gerko Vink.

**Contents**
The repo contains several folders dedicated to different aspects of the Shiny app. It also contains my MSc thesis 'Missing the Point: Non-Convergence in Iterative Imputation Algorithms'.
